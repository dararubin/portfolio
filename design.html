								<p>For this project, our questions was "How might we engage Northwestern students in contributing to a positive community?" and one solution we came up with an app called NU Day. NU Day is similar to a current app called Yik Yak, although NU Day requires students to log in with their Northwestern ID so that their posts are not anonymous. The idea is that students will post positive challenges, ideas, and other random things (there's a list of suggested themes within the app) that will encourage other students to part-take in these positive activities, or at least get students thinking about them. <br><br>Within our app, you have the ability to "save" challenges that you find interesting to a list, and you can check off that you've completed them later, or remove them from your list. You also have a profile where you can keep track of how many challenges you have posted, how many people have saved your challenges, and see how many challenges you have completed. One of the ways we tested our idea was by posting "NU Challenge"s on the Northwestern Yik Yak, (for example: say thank you to the dining hall workers when they give you your food) and our challenges had an overwhelmingly positive response. One of our team members even tried to kill our idea, posting "Can these NU Challenges stop?" and similar posts, none of which caught on. <br><br>
									While our whole team brainstormed what would go into the app, I had a lot of creative freedom in actually drawing the screens out and piecing it together in POP. </p>

								<p>For the last half of the quarter, we were put in pairs and given a task: find a space at Northwestern with public seating, and redesign it. With corrugated cardboard. We picked a space in Tech (see video below to see the space) where the seating - a few couches - is never maximized because students are often unwilling to sit with strangers and end up taking over the space. We also found that the space was not ideal for students who were trying to study, do work, or eat there between classes. We decided to create a modular chair and table piece that could be placed every-other, ensuring that a student could not spread out and take over multiple spaces, and also giving them space on a table to put their items, instead of on the seat next to them.<br><br>
								While this was intended to be a group project, I ended up working solo on the majority of it, so I had the creative freedom to put the chair together as I liked. I also learned how to use a laser cutter in the process, so that was cool.<p></td>
